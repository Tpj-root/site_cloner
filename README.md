Site: https://www.tamil2lyrics.com

This Git repository downloads all Tamil film lyrics. 
The lyrics are downloaded into folders named after each movie, and the song lyrics are saved in HTML format.

How to Use This Code
--------------------
Step 1: Set Up a Python Virtual Environment
Before running the code, it's a good practice to create a virtual environment. This isolates your project and ensures that dependencies do not conflict with other projects.

```
python3 -m venv mysite
source mysite/bin/activate
```

Step 2: Clone My GitHub Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone "https://github.com/Tpj-root/site_cloner.git"
```

Step 3: Install the Required Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Step 4: Run the Code

```
python3 main_2.py
```


Step 5: Run the Code lyrics to txt

```
bash lyrics_html2txt.sh
```

-------------------------

note:
main_1.py â€” This code is used to generate and collect all the film URLs.


-------------------------

Time Required for Runtime

For python3 main_1.py:

    The code processes 270 pages per URL request, and each request takes 10 seconds. 
    Therefore, the total runtime required is approximately 45 minutes. 
    The code has already been run to collect all the film URLs in movie_urls.txt.
    

For python3 main_2.py:

    The command cat movie_urls.txt | wc -l shows that there are approximately 4048 films.
    The total runtime required to download all the movie lyrics is approximately 11+ hours.
    (4048 * 10 ) / (60 * 60) = 11.24 hr



For python3 html2txt.py

    Usage: python3 html2txt.py <inputfile.html> <outputfile.txt>
    
    Function: Reads the HTML content from input_file, parses it with BeautifulSoup,
    extracts the plain text, and writes it to output_file.

    Note:need some data cleaning


For bash lyrics_html2txt.sh

    The Bash script:

    - Finds the movies_sample folder.
    - Recursively reads the movie names.
    - Then reads the names of the HTML lyric files.
    - Finds each HTML file and automatically runs the Python script to convert <filename.html> into <filename.html.txt>.

To-Do:
For Future Days:

    1. Planning for Data Management:
        Create a MySQL database to store all data.
        Design and implement the following tables:
            movies_name_list
            music_directors_list
            singers_list
            songs_list
            lyrics_json

    2. Retrieve Lyrics:
        Write SQL queries to get the lyrics based on specific criteria.
        
    3. Play the song in VLC Player; the lyrics will be displayed on the screen. 
    (Note: I have an idea; implementation details are planned for later.)
