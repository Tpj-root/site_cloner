How to Use This Code
--------------------
Step 1: Set Up a Python Virtual Environment
Before running the code, it's a good practice to create a virtual environment. This isolates your project and ensures that dependencies do not conflict with other projects.

```
python3 -m venv mysite
source mysite/bin/activate
```

Step 2: Clone My GitHub Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone "https://github.com/Tpj-root/site_cloner"
```

Step 3: Install the Required Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Step 4: Run the Code
Finally, run the code with the following command:
```
python3 main_2.py
```
